Turn a stream of text into sound, using the overtone series

Letter A = root note
B = first overtone, double the frequency, one octave above
C = triple
the frequency, an octave plus a fifth above the root
D = x4 frequency, two octaves up
E = x5, two octaves plus a third etc.

Higher notes are normalised down to fit in the octave range specified

Other properties of the text, affect other sound properties, such as volume, tempo, range etc.

Aim:
To transform text into sound (not necessarily music) with aesthetically pleasing and/or interesting output.

Output should be completely deterministic, i.e. there should be no randomness. We want to use only the 
properties of the input text.
